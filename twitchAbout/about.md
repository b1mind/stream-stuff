My name is Brent "be-1-mind".

I can be intense, and sometimes really passionate about what I am saying. Don't let the deep voice scare you. Love sharing and talking about things that interest me!

Husband, father of two kids, and cat Yuki. Returning to Web Development after doing odd jobs for a decade. Currently working as a freelancer while learning online via courses and practice building random things.

Hobbies include coding, designing, gaming, fly tying, fly fishing, hiking.
